                    24-Hour Rule: Cancellations must be made within a 24-hour window from the time of purchase. This policy
                    reflects the company’s commitment to process orders quickly and efficiently, hence the short timeframe

                    of purchase. This acts as a deterrent against capricious cancellations and compensates the company for
                    the potential loss of business and administrative efforts.

                    any subsequent orders. This condition is likely intended to prevent repeated cancellations and ensure
                    that future transactions are conducted with serious intent.

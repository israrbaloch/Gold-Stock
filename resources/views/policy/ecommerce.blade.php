                Gold Stock Canada recognizes the importance of safeguarding the personal information and transaction details

                    We employ a range of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from
                    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This includes the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology
                    to
                    encrypt the transmission of non-public, personally identifiable information over the internet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our website is regularly scanned for security vulnerabilities and known threats, and we use both
                    in-house
                    and third-party solutions to monitor and secure our network and data.

                    While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
                    acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%

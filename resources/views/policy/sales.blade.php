                        We aim for complete customer satisfaction. If you find yourself dissatisfied with your purchase, we
                        accept returns of most items within 2 days after delivery. To be eligible for a refund, the item
                        must be returned unused, in the same condition that you received it, and it must also be in the
                        original packaging. Before returning the item, please check with our customer service to confirm
                        that your item is eligible for return.

                        Upon receiving your return, we will inspect the item and notify you of the status of your refund. If
                        your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment. You can
                        expect the credit to occur within 5 -10 business days from the time we receive your item, although
                        the exact timing may vary depending on your payment provider. Please note that it may take an
                        additional 1-2 billing cycles for the credit to appear on your statement.

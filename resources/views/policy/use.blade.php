            Terms of Use for Gold Stock Canada
        </h1>
        <p>
            Gold Stock Canada ("the Company", "We", "Us", or "Our") is engaged in the business of trading in precious metal
            bullion and related products. We offer a platform for you ("the Client", "You", "Your") to conduct sales and
            purchases of precious metal bullion. Whether you seek to divest a portion of your holdings or to acquire
            additional precious metals for investment, we provide a trusted avenue for such transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                PLEASE REVIEW WITH DILIGENCE:
            </strong>
            The following Terms and Conditions constitute the contractual framework governing all transactions for the
            acquisition of bullion by the Company from the Client ("Seller"), and the dispensation of bullion by the Company
            to the Client ("Buyer"), whether such transactions occur through our digital platforms or via direct
            communication facilitated by the contact details provided on our website. When you propose to transact with the
            Company - by vending or purchasing bullion - you affirm and guarantee that you are vested with the legal
            authority and capacity to agree to these Terms and Conditions, that you have comprehensively assimilated and
            consented to these Terms and Conditions, and that these Terms and Conditions forge a binding contract between
            the Company and you, both on a personal level and, where pertinent, on behalf of any legal entity you represent.
            Should you dissent with any provision of these Terms and Conditions, you are categorically precluded from
            engaging in any trade with the Company, and you are obligated to cease all utilization of our website forthwith.
